# Up Bank Transaction Importer For [Actual Budget](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server)

This project aims to improve the automation of [Actual Budget](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server) by allowing you to connect your [Up Bank](https://up.com.au/) accounts to your budget and have automatic transaction imports.
Up bank has a beautiful [API]((https://developer.up.com.au/)) which allows you to take your finances and manipulate it with code. This encouraged me to switch banks as shockingly no other Australian bank supplies an API for personal use.

A full detailed installation instructions as well as how to setup automated cron jobs coming soon.
